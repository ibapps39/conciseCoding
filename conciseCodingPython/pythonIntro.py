# I want you to start with Python first, because it's easy, widely used, and requires little to get started.
# This will be the most wordy of all lessons since I'll assume you know little to nothing about programming.

# Hi! This is a file, like any other on your computer, except it's for Python.
# <- this is going to be your best friend throughout your entire coding journey. 
# It's a comment, meaning we can put whatever we want here, and the "program" will ignore it. 
# _%as120你好こんにちは😃. See, anything we want!

# Precious metals, silicon, and other parts in a computer are inanimate. They dont speak or think.
# In the event that such components do speak, conciseCoding advises you ignore it.
# But, we can pass power around (control it via dams, transistors) and pretend a positive flow is 1 and no flow as 0.
# Machine code, 0101 translate to 'off on off on'. A low (hardware) level language. Python being a high level one.
# Python is like a thought (Python program) using the nervous system (assembly language), to manipulate air (machine code)
# to form a word. 

# A program, is a way of telling a computer what eletrical signals to produce, and/or how to respond to recieved signals.

# For things to work with minimal overhead/installation, search for a 'Python sandbox'. Python has an official one.
# Otherwise, if you already have Python installed, just use this file or make some.py file.
